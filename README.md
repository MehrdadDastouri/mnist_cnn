# MNIST Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This project demonstrates how to implement a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset.
- Implements a CNN with:
  - Two convolutional layers followed by ReLU and MaxPooling.
  - Two fully connected layers for multi-class classification.
- Trains the model using Cross Entropy Loss and Adam optimizer.
- Visualizes:
  - Some training data.
  - Training loss over epochs.
  - Test predictions with true labels.
